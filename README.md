Computational Aid to Drug Discovery for Alzheimer's disease 

Used the ChEMBL library to extract chemical molecules with IC50 values for specific target
organisms
Predicted the pIC50 values using a Random Forest algorithm and also compared the
performance of various regression models.
The models were evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared metrics to
determine the best performer for predicting bioactivity(pIC50 values in molar units) which is
essential for Synthesising potent drugs.
